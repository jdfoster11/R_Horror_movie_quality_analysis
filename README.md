# R_Horror_movie_quality_analysis
Using R to perform a statistical and regression analysis on a horror movies quality dataset

This project was done around the same time as halloween, so I chose to be festive and looked into a horror movie dataset. I found that longer horror movies had higher overall ratings than shorter horror movies at a 95% confidence level, and the ratings on longer movies were between 0.4 - 0.8 higher on average.

The .RMD file can be used to see the code for the project:
